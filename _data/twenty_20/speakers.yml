  topic: "<b>System Partitioning into Zones, To Do or.Not to Do? Realistic Trade-Offs in Segregating Systems in:</b> System partitioning using zones and conduits is a foundational requirement in known<br>cybersecurity standards such as IEC 62443-based risk assessments. But while it enables<br>more precise Security Level Target (SL-T) assignments and better alignment between<br>threats and mitigations, it's often misunderstood, misapplied, or over-engineered in<br>practice.<br>In this talk, we’ll go beyond the theory and into the real-world implications of system<br>partitioning. We’ll examine why poor or missing segmentation undermines risk<br>assessments, but also why blindly partitioning every system can fragment your control<br>strategy, introduce unnecessary complexity, and create compliance blind-spots.<br>Using IEC 62443-3-2 as a technical case study, I’ll walk through what zones and conduits<br>are meant to achieve, what they actually do in operational environments, and how they can<br>both solve and introduce challenges in security architecture. You’ll learn how partitioning<br>affects SL-Ts, how shared controls lose effectiveness across zone boundaries, and why<br>over-partitioning without operational maturity leads to implementation debt.<br>More importantly, we’ll confront a critical misconception: that every supplier system must<br>fully meet all security (SL-T) requirements internally. In reality, system owners must<br>architect for gaps by using compensating controls at the infrastructure level, not penalize<br>vendors for honesty. We’ll explore how to design architectures that assume variability in<br>supplier security capabilities while still achieving compliance and resilience.<br>This talk is targeted at engineers, architects, and risk professionals working with ICS/OT<br>systems or complex hybrid environments. Whether you're applying IEC 62443, NIST 800-82,<br>ISO/IEC 27005, or working with cloud-native control domains, this session will give you a<br>deeper understanding of partitioning as a strategic architectural tool, and how to use it<br>responsibly."

  topic: "<b>Through the lens of a threat hunter:</b>This session will provide a live and partially pre-recorded walkthrough of a threat hunting scenario. We’ll begin by discussing how the initial hunting hypothesis was developed, followed by a demonstration of a custom piece of malware designed to drop LSASS and evade Microsoft Defender.<br>The presentation will then dive into the process of crafting a hunting query, explaining the logic behind it and how it functions. We'll showcase how the query successfully triggers as a detection rule in Defender when the malware is re-executed. To complete the cycle, we’ll also run the same query in a threat hunting context to identify the activity.<br>Due to the time-consuming nature of some steps, select parts of the demo will be pre-recorded to ensure a smooth and focused presentation."

  topic: "<b>AuraCast: A Multisensory Proof-of-Concept.to Combat Alert Fatigue in Cybersecurity:</b> Security analysts face a constant deluge of alerts, dashboards, and decision-making pressure, leading to cognitive fatigue and missed anomalies. AuraCast is a proof-of-concept system that reimagines network monitoring through multisensory feedback using sound and light to support analyst awareness without adding complexity or screen time.<br>Developed as part of a master's thesis, AuraCast sonifies intrusion detection system alerts and pairs them with ambient IoT-based lighting (via Philips Hue) to create an intuitive, passive alerting environment. The goal? To reduce the cognitive load on analysts and allow faster, more instinctive responses, especially during high-volume alert scenarios.<br>In this session, I present the motivation behind AuraCast, the technical design of the system, and the results from usability testing conducted with both SOC professionals and IT generalists. I explore how auditory and visual modalities can be meaningfully mapped to security events, and how this prototype performed when evaluated against traditional visual-only setups using NASA-TLX cognitive load assessments, response times, and qualitative feedback.<br>I’ll also discuss the practical, unfiltered challenges of building and testing something experimental, from deployment constraints to user scepticism, and reflect on what it would take to bring a concept like this into production in SOC environments.<br>Whether you're interested in human-centred cybersecurity, creative monitoring solutions, or just want to know what happens when intrusion detection meets MIDI and mood lighting, this session offers a unique angle on how we can support the humans behind the screens."

My work spans vulnerability management, detection engineering, and systems hardening, with a particular interest in practical, scalable solutions for SOC environments. While my thesis involved human testing and cognitive load analysis, my focus has always been on the technical design, implementation, and evaluation of tools that improve detection and reduce noise. I enjoy building things that actually work - and then stress-testing them."

  topic: "<b>Bending the Big Iron: An Introduction to Mainframe Hacking:</b> Mainframes underpin a lot more of society than we think - banks, airlines, supermarkets, day-to-day card transactions etc. Daily life would become much more inconvenient - or come to a halt entirely, without them. Yet many in the security community know very little about them and/or consider them legacy technology.<br><br>Having started working with mainframes around 2 years ago, I'd like to raise a bit of awareness and share some knowledge of the area.<br><br>This talk will demystify some perceptions and assumptions about mainframes in general, show that they're far from legacy technology, and give some useful advice on what you can do if you find yourself 'in front' of one or just want to explore further."

  topic: "<b>Dungeons & Dragons: The security tool you didnt know you needed: </b>Tired of security training that puts your team to sleep? What if I told you the most powerful training tool in cybersecurity has been sitting in your game room all along? Welcome to the world of game-based learning, where the proven power of play transforms how professionals master complex skills.<br><br>Research shows that humans learn best when working together, yet traditional training methods keep pushing isolated, theoretical learning. Game-based learning flips this approach on its head, creating environments where people forget about office politics and actually engage with the material. Through structured play and collaborative storytelling, participants don't just memorize concepts—they live them, breaking down professional barriers and building genuine understanding through experience.<br><br>I'll show you the compelling evidence behind why using roleplaying games work, and demonstrate how to transform resistant learners into engaged participants. Using compelling examples, you'll discover how tabletop role-playing mechanics can turn your most challenging training scenarios—from incident response to zero trust architecture—into adventures your team actually looks forward to.<br><br>Join me to learn why adding roleplaying games to your professional development isn't just about making training fun—it's about making it work."
