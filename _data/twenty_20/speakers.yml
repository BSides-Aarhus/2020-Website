  topic: "System partitioning using zones and conduits is a foundational requirement in known<br>cybersecurity standards such as IEC 62443-based risk assessments. But while it enables<br>more precise Security Level Target (SL-T) assignments and better alignment between<br>threats and mitigations, it's often misunderstood, misapplied, or over-engineered in<br>practice.<br>In this talk, we’ll go beyond the theory and into the real-world implications of system<br>partitioning. We’ll examine why poor or missing segmentation undermines risk<br>assessments, but also why blindly partitioning every system can fragment your control<br>strategy, introduce unnecessary complexity, and create compliance blind-spots.<br>Using IEC 62443-3-2 as a technical case study, I’ll walk through what zones and conduits<br>are meant to achieve, what they actually do in operational environments, and how they can<br>both solve and introduce challenges in security architecture. You’ll learn how partitioning<br>affects SL-Ts, how shared controls lose effectiveness across zone boundaries, and why<br>over-partitioning without operational maturity leads to implementation debt.<br>More importantly, we’ll confront a critical misconception: that every supplier system must<br>fully meet all security (SL-T) requirements internally. In reality, system owners must<br>architect for gaps by using compensating controls at the infrastructure level, not penalize<br>vendors for honesty. We’ll explore how to design architectures that assume variability in<br>supplier security capabilities while still achieving compliance and resilience.<br>This talk is targeted at engineers, architects, and risk professionals working with ICS/OT<br>systems or complex hybrid environments. Whether you're applying IEC 62443, NIST 800-82,<br>ISO/IEC 27005, or working with cloud-native control domains, this session will give you a<br>deeper understanding of partitioning as a strategic architectural tool, and how to use it<br>responsibly."
